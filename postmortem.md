## Challenges Encountered

### Technical Challenges

#### 1. Performance Optimization
**Problem:** Initial frame rate drops with multiple animated guards  
**Solution:** Optimized collision detection frequency and used CSS transforms for better performance  
**Learning:** Always profile performance early in game development cycles  

#### 2. Cross-Browser Compatibility
**Problem:** CSS animations behaved differently across browsers  
**Solution:** Used vendor prefixes and tested extensively  
**Learning:** Implement progressive enhancement for better compatibility  

#### 3. Game State Management
**Problem:** Complex state transitions between levels and game states  
**Solution:** Centralized state management in the main game class  
**Learning:** Consider state pattern for more complex games  

### Design Challenges

#### 1. Difficulty Balancing
**Problem:** Initial game was either too easy or frustratingly hard  
**Solution:** Implemented playtesting feedback loop and adjusted guard patterns  
**Learning:** Continuous playtesting is essential for good game balance  

#### 2. Visual Clarity
**Problem:** Players confused about guard detection ranges  
**Solution:** Added visual indicators for guard sight cones  
**Learning:** Always provide clear visual feedback for game mechanics  

## Key Metrics and Outcomes

## Technical Deep Dive

### Architecture Decisions

#### Class-Based Structure
```javascript
class CatwomanGame {
    // Centralized game logic and state management
    // Clear separation between rendering and game logic
    // Event-driven architecture for user interactions
}
```

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Collision Detection:** Used spatial partitioning concepts
- **Animation Performance:** Leveraged CSS transforms over position changes
- **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup of DOM elements between levels

### Code Quality Practices
- **Consistent Naming:** Clear, descriptive variable and function names
- **Documentation:** Inline comments for complex game logic
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation for edge cases
- **Modularity:** Separate concerns for rendering, game logic, and user input

## Lessons Learned
